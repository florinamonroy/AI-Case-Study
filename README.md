## Business Activities

> From Anthropic, ‘Anthropic is an AI safety and research company. [They] build reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems.’ 
> Anthropic is focused on finding clues to how AI works to prevent threats posed by the use of AI. ([NYTimes](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/21/technology/ai-language-models-anthropic.html))

* Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers? Anthropic’s intended customers include technology companies, research institutions, and enterprises that are interested in deploying AI systems responsibly. The market size is substantial, encompassing various sectors looking for safe and ethical AI solutions such as the financial and healthcare industries [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/roberthart/2024/06/26/anthropics-claude-what-to-know-about-chatgpt-rival-after-latest-model-trounces-industry-giants/) [Kitrum](https://kitrum.com/blog/the-inspiring-story-of-daniela-amodei-anthropics-leader/#Building-safe-AI-for-a-better-world)

* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?) Anthropic was bourn out of safety and values alignment concern. This foundational philosophy is their unfair advantage, in my opinion. [Kitrum](https://kitrum.com/blog/the-inspiring-story-of-daniela-amodei-anthropics-leader/#Building-safe-AI-for-a-better-world)

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? Anthropic employs advanced ML and NLP technologies. They are involved in research on large-scale neural networks and reinforcement learning, implementing these technologies to develop models that align with ethical guidelines and safety standards. More recently, Anthropic introduced Workspaces to compete in the enterprise AI space against ChatGPT Enterprise and Google’s Gemini for Workspace. Anthropic’s approach differs by focusing on ‘expanded context windows and now, granular deployment control.’ Their product, called Claude Enterprise, is able to process vast corporate data allowing more comprehensive insights for complex business scenarios. The addition of Workspaces further differentiates Anthropic’s offering by allowing businesses to create separate environments for development, staging, and production.

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? Focus on establishing consulting services for customers to leverage AI technologies to fast track companies’ product development leveraging Anthropic’s indomitable pursuit and philosophy on value alignment and safety mechanisms. They also need to be able to play in the same space where enterprise platforms like Microsoft’s Office 365 is already deeply imbedded in how companies and their employees operate and function.

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company? Adding a robust consulting services would not only add a reliable revenue stream but also help prove their aspirations as a company, keeping the organization as a top player in the field.

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize? More than technology, they would need an army of AI tech savvy consultants and relationship managers to not only sell the services but also a fast tracked approach to train customers on how to leverage AI technology to transition product development and optimized internal processes.

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution? Talk is cheap. If companies do not adapt product development to AI technology and mechanisms offered by Anthropic and top AI companies, benefits of artificial intelligence will remain aspirational.
